# MAD LIBS

# SPECIFICATIONS: Create a program that contains a script with some lines left blank for user input.
# Prompt the user for input to fill in the blanks, asking for appropriate parts of speech.
# After the user has entered in their contents, print out the story script with their entries to reveal
# their unique (and probably hilarious) story. Advanced Features: 1. A loop that allows them to play the
# game continuously, 2. A menu bar with 2-3 story templates to choose from, 3. color-coded words to
# differentiate the user-input words from the story script.
